# Home_Sales

This challenge marks the end of a very difficult six month bootcamp. I am thankful to have taken it, and will continue to work on data analytics in future jobs because of the skills I learned in this bootcamp. 

Many thanks to Haroon, Angel, and Megan. 
Thanks to my partner for every project, Martin.
Thanks to Nathan-Andrew for being an inspiration. 

This challenge consisted of utilizing SparkSQL to query home sales data in various ways. This included creating temporary tables, caching and uncaching, and then performing queries of varying difficulty. 

I used colab.google for this project, as SparkSQL did not play nicely with my environment.
